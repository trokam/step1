                     How to install a Trokam cruncher
                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Operating system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These instructions are explained as executed in a GNU/Linux Ubuntu 14.04,
however they could be adapted to any other GNU/Linux distribution.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Programs and libraries setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Trokam's crunchers needs these programs and libraries are installed
in order to compile and run,

    g++                       GNU C++ compiler
    make                      An utility for Directing compilation
    wget                      Retrieves files from the web
    html2text                 Advanced HTML to text converter
    libmagic-dev              File type determination library using "magic" numbers
    libexttextcat-dev         Language detection library - development files
    libexttextcat-data        Language detection library - data files
    libjsoncpp0               Library for reading and writing JSON for C++
    libjsoncpp-dev            Library for reading and writing JSON for C++
    libboost-random-dev       Boost Random Number Library

They could be installed with one command,

    sudo aptitude install g++ make wget html2text libmagic-dev libexttextcat-dev libexttextcat-data libjsoncpp0 libjsoncpp-dev libboost-random-dev

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Compilation and installation of Trokam server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Got to 'trokam/client/' directory, compile and install,

    cd trokam/client/
    make clean all install

If copiled without errors then the machine setup was right.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Do some crunching!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You would need to be registered at Trokam server to run,

    cruncher --log-level=TRACE --page-limit=1
    
or use your own server setup,

    cruncher --server-address=192.168.0.1 --log-level=TRACE --page-limit=1

Where that IP address is just an example.
