Collaboration

Trokam has a server which is feed continously by clients,
the "web crunchers" or "crunchers" for short.

In these files you have all you need to build and install
a server and the crunchers.

It would be of great help to the project that you compile, install and
try them.

Instructions for the server are in 'server/README' and for the cruncher
in 'client/README'.

Send your opinions, detected bugs and suggestions for improvement
