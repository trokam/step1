                      How to install Trokam server
                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Operating system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These instructions are explained as executed in a GNU/Linux Ubuntu 14.04,
however they could be adapted to any other GNU/Linux distribution.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Programs and libraries setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Trokam server needs these programs and libraries are installed in order
to compile and run,

    g++                       GNU C++ compiler
    make                      An utility for Directing compilation
    apache2                   Apache HTTP Server
    libapache2-mod-fcgid      FastCGI interface module for Apache 2
    libfcgi-dev               Header files of FastCGI
    libfcgi0ldbl              Shared library of FastCGI
    witty                     C++ library for webapps
    witty-dev                 C++ library for webapps
    libwtfcgi-dev             FastCGI connector library for Wt
    libjsoncpp0               Library for reading and writing JSON for C++
    libjsoncpp-dev            Library for reading and writing JSON for C++
    postgresql                Object-relational SQL database
    libpqxx-3.1               C++ library to connect to PostgreSQL
    libpqxx3-dev              C++ library to connect to PostgreSQL (development files)
    libboost-random-dev       Boost Random Number Library

They could be installed with one command,

    sudo aptitude install apache2 libapache2-mod-fcgid libfcgi-dev libfcgi0ldbl witty witty-dev libwtfcgi-dev libapache2-mod-fcgid g++ make libjsoncpp0 libjsoncpp-dev libpqxx-3.1 libpqxx3-dev libboost-random-dev postgresql

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Directories setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Library Wt (witty) needs an specific directory,

    sudo mkdir /var/run/wt
    sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/run/wt -R
    sudo chmod a+wr -R /var/run/wt

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Apache configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Verify that apache is running

    service apache2 status
     * apache2 is running

Look for the file /etc/apache2/mods-available/fcgid.conf and save a copy,

    cd /etc/apache2/mods-available/
    sudo cp fcgid.conf fcgid.conf.original

Then modify the contents of fcgid.conf into this,

    <IfModule mod_mime.c>
    AddHandler fcgid-script .fcgi
    SocketPath /var/lib/apache2/fcgid/sock
    </IfModule>

    <Directory "/usr/local/bin/trokam/server/">
        SetHandler fcgid-script
        Options +ExecCGI
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

Go to directory /etc/apache2/sites-available/ and save a copy of 000-default.conf

    cd /etc/apache2/sites-available/
    sudo cp 000-default.conf 000-default.conf.original

Edit the file '000-default.conf' to add the lines between 'ScriptAlias ..'
and </Directory>,

    <VirtualHost *:80>
            # The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that
            # the server uses to identify itself. This is used when creating
            # redirection URLs. In the context of virtual hosts, the ServerName
            # specifies what hostname must appear in the request's Host: header to
            # match this virtual host. For the default virtual host (this file) this
            # value is not decisive as it is used as a last resort host regardless.
            # However, you must set it for any further virtual host explicitly.
            #ServerName www.example.com

            ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
            DocumentRoot /var/www/html

            ScriptAlias / /usr/local/bin/trokam/server
            <Directory /usr/local/bin/trokam/server>
                    SetHandler fcgid-script
                    Options +ExecCGI
                    Order allow,deny
                    Allow from all
            </Directory>

            # Available loglevels: trace8, ..., trace1, debug, info, notice, warn,

Restart apache

    sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
PostgreSQL configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Login as 'postgres' user

    sudo su - postgres

Go to the configuration directory of PostgreSQL and make a copy of 'pg_hba.conf',

    cd /etc/postgresql/9.3/main/
    cp pg_hba.conf pg_hba.conf.original

Then modify 'pg_hba.conf' replacing one line as indicated,

    # "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
    ##local   all             all                                     peer
    local   all             all                                     trust

Create the database and user for web data

    createdb some_db
    createuser some_user

Logout as user 'postgres',

    exit

Restart postgres process,

    sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql restart
     * Restarting PostgreSQL 9.3 database server                                                                                  [ OK ] 

Go to trokam/server/db and generate the model for the database using the
same database name and user assigned at creation,

    cd trokam/server/db
    psql -U some_db -d some_user -f web_data.postgres
    SET
    SET
    SET
    SET
    ..

Copy the configuration template,

    sudo mkdir /usr/local/etc/trokam
    sudo cp trokam/server/config/server.cfg /usr/local/etc/trokam

Edit 'server.cfg' and set the same database name and user assigned
at creation,

    [database]
    name = some_db
    user = some_user

Make sure that directory '/usr/local/etc/trokam' and the
file 'server.cfg' are be readabe by all users.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Compilation and installation of Trokam server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Got to 'trokam/server/' directory, compile and install,

    cd trokam/server/
    make clean all install

If copiled without errors then the machine setup was right.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Initializing database with seed URLs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Initialize the database with seed URLs,

    initialize --log-level=TRACE --seeds=(full path)/trokam/server/init/seed_urls_3M.txt

In 'trokam/server/init' there are two files:

    'seed_urls_3M.txt' with 3.614.441 URLs
    'seed_urls_10K.txt' with 10.000 URLs

The second is particularly useful for a quick testing.
